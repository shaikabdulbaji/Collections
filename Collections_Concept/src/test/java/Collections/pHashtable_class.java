 		Hashtable : ( In Hashtable t is small letter )
		----------- 
		• It is a datastructure(like an Array) which stores the objects as key value pair by means of Hashing. 
		• Default size of hashtable is 11 
		• once hashtable reaches the 3/4th of default size it size will be doubled i.e 22.
		 			
 		Dictionary(ac) and Hashtable(c) and Properties(c) and Vector(c) and stack(c) these are Legacy classes	
 		HashMap is latest from Hashtable
 		
 		Diff btw HashMap(c) and Hashtable(c)
		 
		 HashMap(c) : (Latest)
		 1. not Synchronized methods (not Threadsafe)
 			not Threadsafe means multi Thread can acces same time 
		 
		 Hashtable(c) : (Legacy)
		 1. Synchronized methods (Threadsafe)
 			Threadsafe means only single Thread can acces same time

		t.put(102, "Shaik");
		t.put(103, "Baji");
