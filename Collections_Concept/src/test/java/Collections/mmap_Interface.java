/*
 		* Collection(I) and map(I) are roots of Collection Framework
 		* Collection(I) and map(I) are some what like siblings
 		* For Interfaces we can't create objects and for classes we can create objects
 		 
 		Map Interface 
		--------------- 
		• Map is an interface which stores the objects as a key value pair. 
		• Each key,value pair is called as entry. 
		• So map is also referred as collection of entry objects 
		• Whenever we want to represents objects as key value pair we go for maps. 
		• Map interface is implemented by 3 different classes 
			1. HASHMAP 
			2. LINKEDHASHMAP 
			3. TREEMAP
			
	  * Map is another root interface of Collections Framework
	  * Its not the child interface of Collection (I)
	  * Representing a group of objects as key value pairs
	   * Both key and values are objects
	   * Keys are unique (i.e. cannot be duplicated)
	   * Values can be duplicated
	   * Each Key Value Pair is called on Entry
	    * Group of Entries is known as Map
	 * Has several child classes and interfaces
	 * Difference between Collection and Map
	  * Group of Key Value Pairs
	  * Map has its own specific methods which look different from Set 
	 * Map specific methods
	  * Objects cant be created
 		
 		* If you want to represent a group of objects as key value pairs then we go for map(I) 
 		   Example :-  			
 		      			Employees
 		     Employee Id's		Employee Names 		
	 	    	 Key				Value
	 		     101				Shaik
	 		     102				Abdul	
	 		     103				Baji
	 		     104				Rasool
	 		     
	 	* " Combination of Key and Vayue pair is called Entry "
	 	* A group of Entries(Each entry is called key value pair) is called map
